Day 1 business of America

Today I want to talk about the world this week business of America.
I have read the news that, the America economy sharked 4.8% at an annualised rate in the fisrt quarter because of the pedemic. 
But behind the scenes, I heard that the pedemic did little stop to the recent business in America, like stockmarkets. 
So, I think, an inexorable decline, mournful, will happen in America economy if Trump is still comtemptible to take a defensive move against the pedemic.
