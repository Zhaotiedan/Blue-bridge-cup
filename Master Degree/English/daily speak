Day 1 Business Of America

Today I want to talk about the world this week business of America.
I have read the news that, the America economy sharked 4.8% at an annualised rate in the fisrt quarter because of the pedemic. 
But behind the scenes, I heard that the pedemic did little stop to the recent business in America, like stockmarkets. 
So, I think, an inexorable decline, mournful, will happen in America economy if Trump is still comtemptible to take a defensive move against the pedemic.

Day 2  Digital Divide
I have read an article about digital divide, in the authorâ€™s opioin,
the divison of the world is still exist today which is regarded as a looming danger and need to be guarded and emphasised.
But today, the Internet access has made an enormous potential which offers economic potentials, except this, 
the acception of foregin investment will enhance the electronic infrastructure which may well be the best powerful tool for combating the world poverty that we ever had.
